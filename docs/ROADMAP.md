## Vision

Build a calm financial command center powered by invisible intelligence and secure financial infrastructure — designed for multi-currency users navigating complex debt structures across the Philippines, United States, and Singapore.

## 1. What Is Built

### Core Financial Logic — `packages/core`

| `math/loans` | Amortization engine — Standard Amortized, Add-on, Interest-Only, Fixed Principal | ✅ |
| `math/currency` | `convertToBase`, `formatCurrency` | ✅ |
| `regional` | Strategy pattern — `getRegionByCurrency`, regional DTI/budget rules for PH/US/SG | ✅ |
| `analysis/dashboard` | `aggregateDashboardData` — full dashboard payload (used by mobile) | ✅ |
| `analysis/budget` | `generateSmartBudget` — 50/30 rule across expense categories | ✅ |
| `analysis/loans` | `aggregateLoanFinancials` — totalDebt, totalMonthlyInstallment, avgInterestRate, activeLoanCount | ✅ |

| `schema/index` | All DB entity types, enums, `DTIRatioResult`, `LoanMetrics`, `UnifiedTransaction` | ✅ |

**Test coverage:** 33/33 tests pass. Core typecheck clean.

## 2. Active Priorities — P1 (Ship Now)

### P1-C — Advanced Analytics Drilldown
Deep drilldown pages for Cash Flow and DTI Simulator as requested in P3 backlog. ✅

---

## 3. Next Sprint — P2

### P2-A — Dashboard charts (remaining 1)
1. **Net Worth Trend** — Needs asset tracking first. ✅

### P2-B — Signup page cleanup ✅
- Wired `/signup` into login flow; standardized UI with login; shared auth icons extracted to `modules/auth`; email confirmation redirect fixed to `/auth/callback`.

### P2-E — Architectural Consolidation (Dry Principle) ✅
- `packages/db`: Supabase client factories centralized; subpath exports for browser/server/mobile/node. Removes 4-way fragmentation.
- `packages/auth`: `getUser(client)` helper — replaces inline `supabase.auth.getUser()` in dashboard RSCs.
- Dead code removed: `apps/web/utils/supabase/` (unused), `packages/api/src/client.ts` (unused externally).
- `packages/api` cleaned: `@supabase/ssr` dep and `createStashFlowClient` export removed.

### P2-F — Realtime & Feed Scaling ✅
- Transition unified timeline to pagination-first architecture. (Completed: Cursor-based pagination + infinite loading timeline).

---

## 4. Backlog — P3

### P3-A — Advanced Session Intelligence
- Session visibility dashboard with "Revoke All" capability.
- Implementation of login anomaly detection and geo-fencing checks.

### P3-B — CI/CD Security Pipelines
- Integrate `pnpm audit`, secret scanning (Gitleaks/TruffleHog), and automated RLS policy testing into the GitHub Actions workflow.

### P3-C — FX & Ledger Integrity
- **Versioned Exchange Rates:** Immutable snapshots of rates at the time of transaction.
- **Signed Ledgers:** Cryptographic signing of financial mutation events.

### P3-D — Observability & Incident Response
- Transaction spike detection and fraud monitoring alerts.
- Automated escalation workflows for security anomalies.
